# Deobfuscated-Android-Games
So basically I have de-obfuscated some games. 
The only games I have de-obfuscated is Pixel Gun 3D and Standoff 2 (old ver.)

Note: These both games aren't "fully" deobfuscated. 

Pixel Gun 3D(v21.7.0): 5,000+ methods are de-obfuscated.

Standoff 2 (v0.13.x): 511 methods are de-obfuscated.

Again, these games aren't fully deobfuscated. I only managed to deobfuscate some methods and made it viewable with normal names in the csharp.
